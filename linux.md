# Linux

Linux is an open source multi-tasking, multi-user operating system. It was initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Linux OS is widely used in desktops, mobiles, mainframes etc.

# Unix

Unix is multi-tasking, multi-user operating system but is not free to use and is not open source. It was developed in 1969 by Ken Thompson team at AT&T Bell Labs. It is widely used on servers, workstations etc. Following are the important differences between Linux and Unix.


## Following are the important difference between Linux and Unix.

1	Development	

- Linux -  is open source and is developed by Linux community of developers.	

- Unix - was developed by AT&T Bell labs and is not open source.

2	Cost

	 - Linux is free to use.

   -  Unix is licensed OS.

3	Supportd File systems	

- linux - Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, Jfs, ReiserFS, Xfs, Btrfs, FAT, FAT32, NTFS.	

- Unix - fs, gpfs, hfs, hfs+, ufs, xfs, zfs.

4	GUI	

- Linux uses KDE and Gnome.Other GUI supported are LXDE, Xfce, Unity, Mate.

 - Unix was initially a command based OS. Most of the unix distributions now have Gnome.

5	Usage

	- Linux is used in wide varieties from desktop, servers, smartphones to mainframes.

    - Unix is mostly used on servers, workstations or PCs.

6	Default Shell	

- Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is default shell for Linux.	

- Bourne Shell is default shell for Unix.


7	Target processor	


- Linux was initially developed for Intel's x86 hardware processors. Now it supports 20+ processor families.	


- Unix supports PA-RISC and Itanium family.


8	Example	
- Ubuntu, Debian GNU, Arch Linux, etc.	

- SunOS, Solaris, SCO UNIX, AIX, HP/UX, ULTRIX etc.

## Bash

- Bash is a shell software that was created as an improvement to the Bourne Shell application ‘sh.’

-  It is more functional than Bourne Shell in terms of programming and interactive use. 

- It offers features such as command-line editing, key bindings, and endless command history.

- For most Linux distributions and Apple’s macOS, Bash is the default login shell. 

- It’s also available for Windows 10 with a Solaris 11 version and default user shell.

## shell 

- A shell is software that allows users of an operating system to access the kernel’s services through a user interface. 

- A shell can be invoked by the shell command in the command-line interface (CLI) on Unix- or Linux-based OS, letting people manage operations via specific commands, text, or script. 

- Programming languages have their shells, which provide them independence from the operating system and allow cross-platform interoperability.

Rename myFile to myFirstFile:

- mv myFile myFirstFile

View the contents of a file:

- cat myFirstFile

View the content of a file with pager (one screenful at a time):

- less myFirstFile

View the first several lines of a file:

- head myFirstFile
